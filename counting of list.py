# Lets try counting the tuples 
#tuples are simply a colection which is immutable 
#code by IAH (Infinity Aggarwal Harshul)

a = ("C","D","A","A","B","B","A")   #the tuples are collection which are simply closes with round brackets
print(a.count("A"))                 #the count function simply count the occurence of elements entered inside it
print(type(a))                      #here the type function simply tells the above statement type
#The Output will give you the count of above colection of tuples
