#traverse on list using while loop
# code by IAH (infinity Aggarwal Harshul)

a = [1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81,100] #lets take a exmaple list
i = 0                             #here we taken a value equal to zero
while i < len(a) :                #in while statement we taken a condition that if i is less than length of list
    print (a[i])                  #print the list with that i varible  #this will be type of execution going here (a[0],a[1],a[2],.....) 
    i += 1                        #increment the list by 1

#The final output will be travelling in whole example list using while loop and when answer comes it will stop
